 * @notice Consideration is a generalized ETH/ERC20/ERC721/ERC1155 marketplace.
 *         It minimizes external calls to the greatest extent possible and
 *         provides lightweight methods for common routes as well as more
 *         flexible methods for composing advanced orders or groups of orders.
 *         Each order contains an arbitrary number of items that may be spent
 *         (the "offer") along with an arbitrary number of items that must be
 *         received back by the indicated recipients (the "consideration").
