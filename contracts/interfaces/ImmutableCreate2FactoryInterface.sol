 * @notice This contract provides a safeCreate2 function that takes a salt value
 *         and a block of initialization code as arguments and passes them into
 *         inline assembly. The contract prevents redeploys by maintaining a
 *         mapping of all contracts that have already been deployed, and
 *         prevents frontrunning or other collisions by requiring that the first
 *         20 bytes of the salt are equal to the address of the caller (this can
 *         be bypassed by setting the first 20 bytes to the null address). There
 *         is also a view function that computes the address of the contract
 *         that will be created when submitting a given salt or nonce along with
 *         a given block of initialization code.
