/**
 * @title ConsiderationConduit
 * @notice WORK IN PROGRESS! The idea here is that this contract will be another
 *         valid target for "proxied" transfers and will be specified by a new
 *         `conduit` argument on orderParameters, and that the orderType will
 *         now only be 4 options rather than 8 (with 0 being "no conduit" and 1
 *         being "legacy proxy"). The conduit contract will be controlled by
 *         another account (set as an immutable, so any logic around ownership
 *         transfer will live there) that can add and remove "channels" which
 *         are contracts that can instruct the conduit to move ERC20/721/1155
 *         tokens. This lets offerers / facilitators "opt in" to managed upgrade
 *         paths away from the original Consideration contract â€” they just grant
 *         their preferred conduit the token approvals and the controller of the
 *         conduit adds new channels that are authorized to move those approved
 *         tokens.
