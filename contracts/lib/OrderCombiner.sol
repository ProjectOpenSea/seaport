     *                          indicated by the order) to transfer any relevant
     *                          tokens on their behalf and each consideration
     *                          recipient must implement `onERC1155Received` in
     *                          order to receive ERC1155 tokens. Also note that
     *                          the offer and consideration components for each
     *                          order must have no remainder after multiplying

     *                          considered valid.
     * @param criteriaResolvers An array where each element contains a reference
     *                          to a specific order as well as that order's
     *                          offer or consideration, a token identifier, and
     *                          a proof that the supplied token identifier is
     *                          contained in the order's merkle root. Note that
     *                          an empty root indicates that any (transferable)
     *                          token identifier is valid and that no associated
     *                          proof needs to be supplied.
     * @param fulfillments      An array of elements allocating offer components
     *                          to consideration components. Note that each
     *                          consideration component must be fully met in
     *                          order for the match operation to be valid.
     *
     * @return executions An array of elements indicating the sequence of
     *                    transfers performed as part of matching the given
     *                    orders.
