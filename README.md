## Background

Seaport is a marketplace contract for safely and efficiently creating and fulfilling orders for ERC721 and ERC1155 items. Each order contains an arbitrary number of items that the offerer is willing to give (the "offer") along with an arbitrary number of items that must be received along with their respective receivers (the "consideration").

See the [documentation](docs/SeaportDocumentation.md) and the [interface documentation](https://docs.opensea.io/v2.0/reference/seaport-overview) for more information on Seaport.

The Seaport interface can be found [here](reference/lib/SeaportInterface.sol).

## Install

To install dependencies and compile contracts:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ProjectOpenSea/seaport && cd seaport
yarn install
yarn build
```

## Usage

To run hardhat tests written in javascript:

```bash
yarn test
yarn coverage
```

> Note: artifacts and cache folders may occasionally need to be removed between standard and coverage test runs.

To run hardhat tests against reference contracts:

```bash
yarn test:ref
yarn coverage:ref
```

To profile gas usage:

```bash
yarn profile
```

### Foundry Tests

Seaport also includes a suite of fuzzing tests written in solidity with Foundry.

To install Foundry (assuming a Linux or macOS system):

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

This will download foundryup. To start Foundry, run:

```bash
foundryup
```

To install dependencies:

```
forge install
```

To run tests:

```bash
forge test
```

The following modifiers are also available:

- Level 2 (-vv): Logs emitted during tests are also displayed.
- Level 3 (-vvv): Stack traces for failing tests are also displayed.
- Level 4 (-vvvv): Stack traces for all tests are displayed, and setup traces for failing tests are displayed.
- Level 5 (-vvvvv): Stack traces and setup traces are always displayed.

```bash
forge test  -vv
```

For more information on foundry testing and use, see [Foundry Book installation instructions](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation.html).

To run lint checks:

```bash
yarn lint:check
```

Lint checks utilize prettier, prettier-plugin-solidity, and solhint.

```javascript
"prettier": "^2.5.1",
"prettier-plugin-solidity": "^1.0.0-beta.19",
```

## Contributing

Contributions to Seaport are welcome by anyone interested in writing more tests, improving readability, optimizing for gas efficiency, or extending the protocol via new zone contracts or other features.

When making a pull request, ensure that:

- All tests pass.
- Code coverage remains at 100% (coverage tests must currently be written in hardhat).
- All new code adheres to the style guide:
	- All lint checks pass.
	- Code is thoroughly commented with natspec where relevant.
- If making a change to the contracts:
	- Gas snapshots are provided and demonstrate an improvement (or an acceptable deficit given other improvements).
	- Reference contracts are modified correspondingly if relevant.
	- New tests (ideally via foundry) are included for all new features or code paths.
- If making a modification to third-party dependencies, `yarn audit` passes.
- A descriptive summary of the PR has been provided.
