# Seaport Order Validator

The SeaportValidator contract offers various validation methods to ensure that supplied Seaport orders are being constructed correctly. Most contract calls return an `ErrorsAndWarnings` struct with two `uint16` arrays to help developers debug issues with their orders.

See below for the full list of Errors and Warnings.

The contract is deployed to the following addresses:

Special thanks to:
- [arr00](https://github.com/arr00), who deployed an earlier version of a SeaportValidator contract which can be found [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0xF75194740067D6E4000000003b350688DD770000#code)
- [stephankmin](https://github.com/stephankmin), who extended the SeaportValidator contract to support more errors/warnings and arbitary Seaport instances with compatible versions
- [horsefacts](https://github.com/horsefacts), who implemented support for a ready-only version of the helper contract
